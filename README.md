Final project. My colleague and I developed an advanced platform that simulates the Metaverse, with a primary focus
on integrating knowledge. If the Metaverse eventually replaces the traditional Internet, our platform could serve as a
potential alternative to platforms like Udemy or YouTube. Operating on the Ethereum network, our platform offers
virtual lands represented as NFTs. These lands are owned by individuals who possess valuable knowledge and want to
share it by uploading videos. Users interested in acquiring this knowledge can purchase subscriptions using our
currency.
